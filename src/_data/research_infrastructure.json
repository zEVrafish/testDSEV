Analysis of particles between 450-800 nm require authorization from the FACS Core Facility. Particles above 800 nm cannot be acquired on this instrument.\n\n#### Whom to contact\n\nFACS Core Facility at Aarhus University\\\n<https://biomed.au.dk/research/core-facilities/facs-core-facility>\n\n#### Access\n\nPaid access or service\n",
