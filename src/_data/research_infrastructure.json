      "body": "#### Description\n\nWe have two approaches: genetic engineering of endogenous EVs with a fluorescent reporter and microinjection of (fluorescently labelled) EVs including, but not limited to, human-derived EVs. In both cases, EVs are imaged in live zebrafish embryos using optical microscopes to study the secretion & uptake kinetics (via transgenesis), biodistribution (if microinjected), and interactions with cells of interest (e.g. macrophages and endothelial cells). Our genetic approach is not just about fluorescent labelling; we can engineer EVs in any way through transfection of zebrafish embryos to obtain in vivo results within a week. Collaborations on tissue injury models and EV injections are welcome!\n\n#### Whom to contact\n\nYuya Hayashi\\\n<https://mbg.au.dk/yuya-hayashi/>\n\n#### Access\n\nThrough collaborations",

The EV Array is performed in multi-well cassettes in a high-throughput manner (up to 21 samples per slide), but is still easy to handle in the laboratory. The use of microarray as a platform with spots of >1 nL volumes minimizes the cost of the EV Array as only small amounts of antibodies are needed.\n\n#### Whom to contact\n\nEV Array\\\n<https://evarray.dk>\n\nVesikelforskning\\\n<https://aalborguh.rn.dk/Forskning/Forskningsomraader/Laegefaglige-specialer/Klinisk-Immunologi/Forskningsomraader/Vesikelforskning>\n\n#### Access\n\nThrough collaborations"
