## New DSEV Initiative: Sandwich Grants for Local EV Communities
DSEV’s mission is to advance EV research by promoting scientific communication among researchers in Denmark at all career stages. Our annual symposium is an excellent opportunity to connect EV researchers nationwide, and we now also wish to support local EV communities through a new initiative we have termed: "Sandwich Grant".

### Aim
The aim of the Sandwich grant is to strengthen research communication and education at the local community level. The grant is intended to cover basic catering (sandwiches and refreshments) to increase attendance at local meetings, raise awareness of EV research, and foster scientific collaboration. We envision the grant serving as a catalyst for establishing and sustaining local communities for open scientific discussion and new collaborations across departments.

### Grant size
DSEV allocates a total of DKK 5.000 per semester for a couple of Sandwich grants.

### Requirements and grant conditions
The requirements are simple. Your local EV community must have:

1. a name
2. a website or equivalent (e.g. a LinkedIn page)
3. members from research groups
4. a designated contact person

If awareded, DSEV requests three things from grant recipients before processing reimbursement.

1. To acknowledge the financial support on the community website or equivalent
2. To send a photo with attendees at the activities to [web@dsev.dk](mailto:web@dsev.dk) for use on DSEV's social media accounts and website
3. To keep receipts of the expenses within the amount granted and send them to [contact@dsev.dk](mailto:contact@dsev.dk)

### Application process
The deadline for the Spring 2026 call is 1st March 2026. The applicant should download the form <a href="https://dsev.dk/data/sandwich_grant_application_form.docx">here</a> and submit the completed form to [contact@dsev.dk](mailto:contact@dsev.dk).
