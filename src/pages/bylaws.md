description: Bylaws of the Danish Society for Extracellular Vesicles (DSEV)

---
## NAME and OBJECTIVE:
§1. The name of the society is ”Danish Society for Extracellular Vesicles”, or in Danish “Dansk Selskab for Ekstracellulære Vesikler”, abbreviated as DSEV.

§2. The objective of the Society is to advance research in extracellular vesicles nationally and internationally through promoting scientific communication among scientists in Denmark at all career stages.

## MEMBERS: 
§3. As its members the Society can accept both Danish and non-Danish scientists who agree to the Society's objectives. 

§4. The membership is linked to registration of participation in the Society's activities such as the Annual Symposium (cf. §13). Admission of honorary membership is described in §6.
> (2). The membership is valid for one year and is renewed by participating in an event organised by the Society where registration fee is required.
> (3). The membership rights of Board members do not lapse as long as they remain on the Board, and they can be re-elected in their absence at the General Assembly.

§5. The Board is empowered to delete a member from the Society's list of members if the person fails, despite written warnings, to settle the payment incurred for participation in the Society's activities.

§6. By decision of a General Assembly following a proposal by the Board or by at least ten of the Society's members, the Society can award honorary membership that does not lapse. Such members have the same rights as the Society's ordinary members.

## MANAGEMENT OF THE SOCIETY: 
§7. The Society is managed by the Board consisting of at least five members: a president, a vice-president, a treasurer, a secretary, and a PR/web manager, and other members at large. Ideally, the composition of the Board should reflect the Society's geographical distribution taking into account the gender balance and career stages ranging from students to established researchers.
> (2). The Board is to appoint the president, vice-president, treasurer, secretary, and PR/web manager from among the Board members. 
 
§8. The Board members are elected for two years at a time, but re-election can take place. The incumbency of the president is, however, limited to three consecutive election periods. After leaving the office of president, she/he may be elected to the Board again, though not for the office of president. After four years' absence from that office, she/he may be re-appointed as president. 

§9. The Society's accounts are to be audited by two accountants who are elected along with two deputies from among the members at the General Assembly. 
> (2). Summary of the audited account must be presented at the General Assembly and the details made available for general viewing upon request from a member.

##ACTIVITIES OF THE SOCIETY 
§10. The Society's year is the calendar year.
§11. To participate in the Society's activities, she/he must hold valid membership (cf. §4) unless being invited as a guest or sponsor on a specific event. The Board may also
arrange an open event where a registration fee is not required for participation, but participation in such an event does not grant membership.

§12. Meetings in the Society are to be announced on the DSEV webpage as well as in writing to each member and non-members subscribed to the DSEV mailing list, and if possible and appropriate in relevant scientific publications. Such announcements are normally to be made public at least seven days before the meeting in question.
> (2). All written announcements from the Board in the form of a physical letter are to be accompanied by the Society's full address Urbansgade 36, 9000 Aalborg.

§13. The Society shall hold scientific meetings at times and places under rules determined by the Board. One of the meetings shall be designated as the Annual Symposium and is to be in conjunction with the General Assembly.

§14. For presentation at the General Assembly, the Board is to prepare an annual report that contains a brief overview of the Society's activities in the past year. 

## GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AMENDMENTS TO BYLAWS, and DISSOLUTION OF THE SOCIETY:
§15. The Society's General Assembly is to be held once a year in conjunction with the Annual Symposium. The agenda shall contain the following topics: 
1. Election of a notetaker for the General Assembly.
2. Election of a meeting leader for the General Assembly.
3. Annual report of the Society's activities in the past year.
4. Presentation of the audited financial summary of costs for approval. 
5. Proposals from the Board or from members.
6. Members of the Board on election. 
8. Election of two financial auditors and deputies for these. 
9. Other topics from the Board or from members.

§17. Proposals to be discussed or acted upon under Topic 5 in §15 at the ordinary General Assembly must be submitted to the Board in writing and must be received by the Board at least two weeks before the general assembly.

§18. If, under special circumstances, the Annual Symposium is cancelled or merged with another event, the General Assembly shall be held online and must be announced on the DSEV webpage as well as in writing at least three weeks before the meeting (date of postmark). The agenda must be announced, cf. §20.

§19. The General Assembly is to be led by the meeting leader elected. The General Assembly makes its decisions by simple majority of vote, except for those given in §§ 6, 20, and 21.
> (2). All elections (except for that of a meeting leader) shall take place by secret, written ballot, if just one member so wishes. The president has the deciding vote in case of equal votes.

§20. Changes or amendments to these bylaws may only be made following approving vote at the General Assembly. The full wording of the amendment(s) shall be sent out to each member two weeks before the General Assembly.
> (2). A proposed amendment may only be voted upon if it was made known to the members in full.
> (3). Approval of the proposed amendment(s) is only valid when at least two-thirds of the members present at the General Assembly vote for the proposal.

§21. Dissolution of the Society can only take place if based on a proposal from the Board or on a written and motivated proposal that has been submitted to the Board by at least twenty members. The proposal must first be debated and approved by an ordinary General Assembly, and subsequently, by an extraordinary General Assembly. The latter must take place at least three weeks after, and at the most two months after, the ordinary General Assembly. To be valid, the proposal must be approved by both General Assemblies by a
two-thirds majority. In the case of the dissolution of the Society, the final General Assembly determines the disposition of the Society's capital and other assets.
