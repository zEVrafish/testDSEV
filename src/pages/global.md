## International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV)
<a href="https://www.isev.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISEV</a> is the largest society for EV researchers across the world.
See <a href="https://www.isev.org/national-societies-global-ev-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for a directory of national societies.

## Student Network on Extracellular Vesicles (SNEV)
Founded in 2020 as a semi-autonomous entity within ISEV, <a href="https://www.isev.org/snev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SNEV</a> is an initiative that aims to foster strong connections between SNEV and global EV societies by building bridges through their Early Career Researchers (ECRs) communities. It promotes open communication and collaboration to strengthen the global EV-research network, while fostering a supportive community for the ECRs.

At DSEV, we have a SNEV ambassador whose aim is to connect student members of DSEV with activities happening at SNEV. Questions? Contact [the ambassador (mailto)](mailto:student@dsev.dk). 

## MObility for VEsicles research in Europe (MOVE) 
<a href="https://www.ukev.org.uk/move-mobility-ev-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOVE</a> is not a society itself but an alliance to promote mobility of ECRs across Europe through providing short-term fellowships (MOVEr). At DSEV, a MOVE fellowship is granted annually following selection by the DSEV Board. To apply for a MOVE fellowship, see the page on DSEV Grants.
