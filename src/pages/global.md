## International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV)
<a href="https://www.isev.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISEV</a> is the largest society for EV researchers across the world.
See [Global EV Societies](https://www.isev.org/national-societies-global-ev-network) for a directory of national societies.

## Student Network on Extracellular Vesicles (SNEV)
Founded in 2020 as a semi-autonomous entity within ISEV, [SNEV](https://www.isev.org/snev) is an initiative that aims to foster strong connections between SNEV and global EV societies by building bridges through their Early Career Researchers (ECRs) communities. It promotes open communication and collaboration to strengthen the global EV-research network, while fostering a supportive community for the ECRs.

At DSEV, we have a SNEV ambassador whose aim is to connect student members of DSEV with activities happening at SNEV. Questions? Contact [the ambassador](mailto:student@dsev.dk). 

## MObility for VEsicles research in Europe (MOVE) 
[MOVE](https://www.ukev.org.uk/move-mobility-ev-europe/) is not a society itself but an alliance to promote mobility of ECRs across Europe through providing short-term fellowships (MOVEr). At DSEV, a MOVE fellowship is granted annually following selection by the DSEV Board.

### MOVE application process
The fellowship is intended for research technicians, PhD students and early-stage postdoctoral researchers (≤ five years, excluding career breaks). There may be some exceptions, for example, suitable applications from master students. The fellowship will cover travel and subsistence (but not bench fees or salary) to work within a host lab at an academic institution in a different European country for between one and three months, up to a maximum value of DKK 15.000. The travel must be performed within 12 months after being awarded.

Process:

1. Identify a suitable registered host lab for your project ([Find the host lab here](https://www.ukev.org.uk/move-mobility-ev-europe/))
2. Contact the host lab directly to discuss your proposed project
3. Apply for the fellowship by directly mailing to [DSEV](mailto:contact@dsev.dk).
4. The fellowship will be awarded at the DSEV Annual Meeting.
5. The travel must be performed within 12 months after being awarded and documented with a short presentation (15 minutes) at General Assembly in the following year.

The application must include:

1. Short motivation (10 lines)
2. Project description (1 page)
3. CV including a list of publications (max two pages)
4. Budget (travel, accommodation, consumables, including any co-financing from the sending institution and the host lab)
5. Signed hosting letter (1 page)

Please note that the intellectual properties, ethical approvements, non-disclosure agreements, and data ownership are held with the host labs. We recommend the home lab of the participant and the foreign host lab agree on these matters. DSEV renounces any liability regarding approvements and agreements.
