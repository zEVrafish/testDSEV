The 6th DSEV Annual Symposium in 2025 was held in Aarhus with record numbers in many aspects. We had 114 participants, 9 sponsors, 23 posters and 10 oral presenters! Let's thank again the financial support by the sponsors: AH Diagnostics, BD, Bio-Techne, BioNordika, CliniSciences, Holtra, Oleinitec, Proteintech, and Repligen! (listed in alphabetical order)

Thank you for a great meeting - and please mark your calendars for next year's symposium on the 1st of October 2026. From 2027, the annual symposia will take place in Feb/Mar, to avoid overlaps with MOVE symposia.
