Three DSEV members participated in the 3rd MOVE Symposium 2025 in Tartu, Estonia (7-10th Oct). It was a great event bringing together EV researchers across Europe, and an excellent place for networking from students to professors, thanks to the comfortable size of the meeting (200-300 participants). The idea of MOVE symposia is to keep it at a low price â€“ students are thus encouraged to participate!

Next MOVE symposium is planned in Budapest, Hungary (2027), and then in Portugal (2029).
