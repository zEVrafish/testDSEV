### Brief job description

Do extracellular vesicles really deliver the cargo and alter behaviour of the recipient cells? If you're in doubt, let's work together and get some evidence for it! We have a 2-year postdoc position starting earliest at 1st April.

The project is funded by Lundbeck Foundation through the LF Experiment grant "*A Brain-wide Atlas of Cell-to-Cell Communication via Extracellular Vesicles*". Through the project, you will be trained as an expert in the extracellular vesicle field with skills in genetic engineering of extracellular vesicles (including transient/stable transgenesis of zebrafish), live embryo imaging, and single-cell/spatial transcriptomics.

\--- Important info ---\
Project duration: 2 years\
Place of work: Aarhus University\
Expertise wanted: single-cell and/or spatial transcriptomics

The application deadline is 20th Feb 2026, but **please do contact me (Associate Professor Yuya Hayashi, yuya.hayashi@mbg.au.dk) early** if you're interested to hear more about the project.
